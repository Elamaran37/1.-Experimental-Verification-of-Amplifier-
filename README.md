### **A.Inverting Amplifier**

This is the most widely used op-amp configuration.  
The output voltage Vo  is fed back to the inverting input terminal through the  Rf - R1 network.  
A = -Rf/R1
Take  A = 10
Rf =10 R1
Choose R1 = 10kΩ, Rf=100kΩ

---
### **B.Non-Inverting Amplifier**

If the signal is applied to the non-inverting input terminal without inversion, it is called a **non-inverting amplifier**.  
Here, the output is fed back to the inverting terminal, and **no phase shift** occurs.

---
### **C.DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER**

A circuit that amplifies the **difference** between two input signals is called a **Differential Amplifier**.  
It is useful in instrumentation applications.  
	
---

## DESIGN
### **Differential Amplifier**

AV = Vo/{V1 - V2} = -Rf/R1


Take  A = 10 
⇒  Rf = 1R1   
Choose  R1 = 15kOhm, Rf = 15kOhm
